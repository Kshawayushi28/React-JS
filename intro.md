** REACT ROADMAP **

-> hype, job, trend, build UI
-> makes easy to manage & build complex frontend

****  Don't be the React Developer  ****

**** job market is high, salary is high ****

* When should I learn React?

-> After mastering JS
-> most project don't need react in initial phase

* Why React was created?

    ->Babel, fibre, Virtual DOM, diffing algo, hydration, tree Shaking
-> by making projects (one topic at a time)
    ->Background Changer, Todo, calculator, Github API

* React is a library

-> Core of react (state or UI manipulation, JSX)
-> Component Reusability
-> Reusing of Component (properties)

    -> Redux, Redux toolkit, zustand, context API (hooks)
-> class based component
    ->legacy code
